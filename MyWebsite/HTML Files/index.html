				<h2>My Objective</h2>
				<!--
				<p>
					Academically motivated college school student with 2 years of particle physics research and work experience as a web developer and software engineering intern. Passionate about new fields of applied physics and machine learning. One of my primary goals for my education and career is to conduct any research to benefit our current understanding of artificial intelligence in hopes of one day developing a sentient machine.

The notion of hard work is often ill-conceived. Many times, we fail to recognize that hard
work is not solely determined by effort, but how we use that effort to achieve what matters. In
order to accomplish something meaningful, we have to consider which goals are important. In
my case, I started to develop my understanding of hard work from the beginning of my
fifth-grade essay writing course. As I walked into the classroom for the first time, the most
memorable thing that I noticed was a large wall packed with shelves of seemingly random items.
The teacher’s wall had many posters and pictures of things that made a statement about her
identity, including a framed family portrait, a beaming student review, and the intimidating
Wisconsin Badgers mascot. However, the item that caught my attention the most was a huge
eraser sitting on her top shelf. On it were inscribed the words, “For BIG Mistakes”. Although I
had never been particularly keen on using erasers because they signified redoing what was good
enough, I started to ask myself what was good enough. “Use it wisely,” she said, after seeing me
staring at it. Cherishing the gift of revision, I examined aspects of my life very carefully to
remove the mistakes I found.

By the end of the year, the eraser was now a pile of eraser shavings soaked in what used
to be writing. Throughout the month prior, our class had received and workshopped a major
project involving an essay presented on a poster. After receiving a 95 on the first draft, I spent
several hours late at night revising for those last few points. I had sacrificed my peace of mind
and ability to relax for that last month just to marginally increase the quality of an old project and
pass a mental boundary. But why did I do it? At the time, I believed that the core principle of
hard work was to refuse to accept any standard short of perfection, as is human nature.
However, I was forced to question this definition of hard work and whether it was worth the toil
in later years. There were times when I found I had fewer hours in a day than it would take to
complete every task flawlessly, and I soon realized that I would have to consider how much of
what I accomplished mattered to me. The only way humanity has achieved anything meaningful
is through the hard work and ingenuity of individuals. To answer the question, I considered the
kind of impact I wanted to have on humankind. My vision for the future is one where humanity
is more intelligent and efficient than currently possible with the help of sentient AI supplements.
"Deep learning", a subset of machine learning, is rapidly improving in mimicking the human
decision-making process, so investigating deep learning will further research in developing
sentient AI. I believe that this is a goal worth fighting for, and it is the motivation for my hard
work.

Throughout my time in high school, I strived to develop my understanding of computer
science and machine learning to alter the state of technology in the future. To get practice in
theoretical research, I worked as an intern at the Fermilab particle physics lab. My job was to
generate graphs and displays of particle interaction data using C++ code and to present findings
in the paper. This was my first experience conducting novel research, and I learned a lot about
the subject. Although my work was not perfect, it made me realize that I did contribute to the
field in some way. In the grand scheme of things, hard work is not defined by how close to perfect one’s work is
but how by much one contributes to what matters to them.
