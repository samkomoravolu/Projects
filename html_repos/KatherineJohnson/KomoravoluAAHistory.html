			<b>Intro</b>
			<br>
			Katherine Johnson was a famous mathematician and physicist
			who worked at NASA. During her career, she helped pioneer
			the usage of computers to perform difficult calculations.
			Johnson calculated launch windows, trajectories and emergency
			return paths for Project Mercury. She was one of the first
			African-American women to work at NASA.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Education</b>
			<br>
			Johnson was born on August 26, 1918 in West Virginia with
			three siblings. Joylette Coleman was her mother, and worked
			as a teacher. Her father was Joshua Coleman, who was a
			lumberman, handyman, and a farmer. From a young age, she
			had great mathematical capabilities. Graduating from the
			West Virginia institute at age 14, She attended West
			Virginia State. At this college, she competed every math
			course offered. At 18, she graduated <i>summa cum laude</i>.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Career</b>
			<br>
			After graduating from college, Johnson became a teacher in
			1937 in Marion, Virginia. In 1939, she left her job to enter
			a graduate math program. One year later, she quit to focus on
			her family. In 1953, the National Advisory Comittee for
			Aeronautics (NACA) offered he a job in the Guidance and
			Navigation Department. Initially, she worked in a group of
			women performing complex calculations. Until
			1958, she carried out calculations reguarding gust
			alleviation for aircraft. On October 1st, 1958, NACA turned
			over operations to NASA, and Johnson shifted to an aerospace
			technologist, working in the Spacecraft Controls Branch.
			Johnson calculated the tracectory for the 1961 flight of
			Alan Shepard, the first American in space. Later in her
			career, she had worked with digital computers, and had helped
			gain confidence in computers. In 1986, Johnson had retired,
			having worked at NACA and NASA for 33 years.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Conclusion</b>
			<br>
			Overall, Katherine Johnson has revolutionized the field of
			mathematics. She was an African-American woman in the field
			of math, which is difficult to accomplish. At NASA, she was
			able to perform difficult calculations with great accuracy,
			and introduced the use of computers to perform such tasks.
			Her work won many awards such as the Honorary Doctor of
			Science in 2006 and the Congressional Gold Medal on November
			8th, 2019.
